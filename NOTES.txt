Notes about my iPython notebooks:

1. ANN.ipynb

    - Contains the ANN model from class
    
2. augment.ipynb

    - This is a custom class which I use for applying image rotation.
    - It contains 3 functions:
        - shuffle_data -> This randomly shuffles all the rotated values and targets while keeping them intact together 
        - augment_data -> Here I loop twice over the values in the training set to apply rotation both clockwise and anticlockwise 
        - fit_augmented_model -> Function to train either a k-NN or ANN using the augmented data 

3. kNN.ipynb 

    - Contains the kNN model from class
    - added new test with activations to using encodings from Autoencoder
    
4. preprocess.ipynb

    - Custom class containing all the necessary preprocessing functions

5. sim_metrics.ipynb

    - Notebook containing similarity/distance metrics for k-NN
    

7. utils.ipynb

    - Contains some global variables and helper functions
